The ServerMessages class is a component of the Multiplayer extension project. This classes purpose is to contain the server messages data classes that the clients will use to send data to the server. For this recipe, the ServerMessages class contains only one message which stores an ID, x and y touch coordinates, and a color ID that will ultimately be read by the server, which then in-turn relays it to the rest of the clients.
