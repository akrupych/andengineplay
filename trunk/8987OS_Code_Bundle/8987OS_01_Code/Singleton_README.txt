1. The singleton class creates a single instance of itself when the program is launched. 

2. The constructor is not public since we only need one instance for use throughout the entire project

3. Because of the private nature of our singleton class, we'll use "getter" and "setter" methods for interacting with the instance.

Installation:
Copy the code into your project and import the required classes.
