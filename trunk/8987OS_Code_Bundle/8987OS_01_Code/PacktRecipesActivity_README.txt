This activity class is the entry point to every AndEngine-based application. We will be using this class activity as a reference in which to build/test applications of the various topics throughout the chapters of the book. 

Installation:
To setup this activity, simply create a new android project in eclipse named PacktActivity. Once the project is created, replace the entire code in the project's main class file with the PacktActivity class provided with the book and import the missing classes to the project (you can do this by mousing-over errors and clicking the "Import" links related to AndEngine classes).

Alternately, if you'd like to create a project under a different name, follow these same steps while excluding the PacktActivity name as the class file in your copy/paste.
