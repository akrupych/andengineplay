1. In this class we are creating one sound object and one music object. The music object has looping enabled.

2. Our sound and music objects each have their own 'play' method, which plays the sound once for the sound object. For the music object, the audio track will continuously replay until looping is set to false or its 'pause' method is called.

Methods:
loadSounds - This method loads our audio-related objects. The loadSounds method should be called in the onCreateResources method of our BaseGameActivity class.

Installation:
Copy the code into your project and import the required classes.
